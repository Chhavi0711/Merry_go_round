# Merry_go_round
This project involves the design and fabrication of a small-scale merry-go-round powered by a DC motor, integrated with a dancing doll animated through a servo motor and controlled by Arduino.

## Description
The Merry-Go-Round Project was built to simulate a real-life amusement ride using both mechanical and electronic systems. A 12V DC gear motor drives the rotation of the platform, while a servo motor animates a mounted doll with rhythmic movements. Gears, rods, and linkages were carefully fabricated and assembled from mild steel and PLA using lathe, welding, milling, and 3D printing. The project demonstrates interdisciplinary learning in mechanical design, embedded systems, and motion synchronization using Arduino.

## Features
- Rotating Platform: The base spins smoothly, driven by a gear-coupled DC motor.

- Animated Doll: Servo motor provides timed dancing motion for the attached figure.

- Mechanical Integration: Gear-based transmission and linkages ensure accurate motion.

- Electronic Control: Arduino manages both timing and motor synchronization.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO: Programmed to control motor speeds and coordinate timing.

- Fusion 360: Used for modeling part geometry and preparing fabrication drawings.

- 12V DC Motor & Servo Motor: Provide rotational and animated motion respectively.

- Mild Steel & PLA: Materials used to fabricate structural and dynamic components.

- Lathe, Milling, Welding & 3D Printing: Employed for shaping, joining, and assembling parts.
